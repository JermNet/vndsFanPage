							I. Love. Clannad (hopefully the banner didn't make it too obvious, hahaha). I really don't know how else to put it but, well, I have a story that I think perfectly explains how I feel about my favourite visual novel and anime. I first watched the anime on a whim, it looked interesting enough, and it was on Canadian Netflix at the time. To be honest, I really didn't enjoy it that much, I even stopped watching after episode 12 (labeled as "season 1" on Netflix). But, I hate leaving things unfinished so, some time after, I continued it. I liked the latter half of Clannad a lot more, enough more to see if there was any more Clannad media I could consume. Of course, I found out about After Story, the visual novel and even the movie! I went with After Story as it is the season 2 to Clannad in everything but name. It got me pretty emotional, I didn't cry, but it really poked at my heart with a lot of force. I never played a "real" visual novel before then but Clannad really had enough of a pull to make me try an entire new medium! It's really that spectacular.
						</p>
						<p>
							I remember the day it broke me very well. It was the Summer, and I was reading through After Story on my crusty, USB ports rusted laptop in the dark. It sounds pretty sad in retrospect, but the mood was just right, and I was enjoying myself. Then I got to the part where Tomoya finally reconciles with his father and... I started crying. I never cried over a piece of media before. It's not like I felt emotionless over other stories. Anime, games, and movies could all get me plenty sad but never enough to shed any tears. I cried as I continued reading through their conversation, it was a bit awkward when my brother walked in on the scene hahaha... He asked me something, but I don't remember it now, I was too caught up in my emotions. I don't know why it was that scene of all the ones in the VN. There are plenty of sadder or more emotional ones, and it's not like it was a scene that had some personal emotional effect on me; my dad and I are on good terms. It just made me cry. Maybe if that was all, I wouldn't have as much as of a liking for Clannad as I do, but there's one other thing about the experience that I didn't find out about until a little later. I was watching some movie, I can't remember what, but it was one I had seen before, and it wasn't a particularly sad movie either. Yet, I kind of sad scene came on, and I could feel myself on the verge of tears. That's how Clannad broke me. Now, whenever a character even gets close to crying or gets a bit sad, I feel my tears start welling up. It's quite a verbose way of saying "I love Clannad" but it means so much to me that I couldn't forgive myself if I didn't share that story. It is the only piece of media to have such a great effect on my life and for that, I couldn't be more grateful. That's why this page exists, to share and talk about this thing that means so much.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyway, I think that's quite enough for a backstory, I've explained why this page has come into being, but I guess I should explain what it's about. Well, I suppose the title explains itself; this is about all things Clannad! The main focus is the visual novel and anime, but there's stuff about the movie, manga and other related things here! Here's a good old table of contents of all the things here on this page for you to enjoy!

					<h3>A Brief(?) Summary</h3>

						<p>
							If you've never played a traditional visual novel before, I think Clannad is a pretty good place to start in all honesty. Then again, that might be kind of pointless to say since, if you're here, you've probably played it before. But I guess if you've watched the anime, you may not have read the visual novel. It has the traditional "choices to get endings" style, but it's broken up into the character routes and After Story. You have to finish all the character routes (with two exceptions) to unlock After Story which follows up on Nagisa's route. The anime is kind of the same but since the seasons are about the same length, the "character route" section leaks over into the After Story of the anime quite a bit. In terms of options to play the VN there really aren't any. For English speakers (or, I guess readers in this case) anyway. It's on Switch, PS4/PS5 and Steam all digitally. If you want a physical copy for the consoles, they aren't region-locked and there is an English language option, but you will have to import. And I've seen import copies float around $100 CAD (~$75USD) so not horrible all things considered Still, if you just want to play it, and you don't have a preference on platform, I would recommend the Steam version. All modern versions are the same, so I just say Steam since you can play it on anything that has your Steam account. If you haven't played the VN before, I would recommend going through it at least once (maybe 2 or 3 times) without a guide just for the fun of it. When I first went at it, I tried getting the Nagisa route first but ended up with Koumura, and then I think I tried going for Kyou but ended up getting no ending. It was fun, but you need a guide after a few goes about it.

							Here's the guide that I used when going through Clannad again for this webpage as well as the Dangopedia guide I used. The Dangopedia is completely optional as it's just a dictionary of terms someone from North America might be unfamiliar with. Entries are added when a word highlighted in red first appears and, since I got all the light orbs and achievements when I first played Clannad, I figured this might be a good addition this time around. Since we're now transitioning more into the specifics of Clannad, it's time for the next part of this webpage. I'm going to review all the routes from my least favourite to my favourite and the give a summary of my thoughts on the VN at the end. So let's get right to it then, shall we?

			<h2>A Route By Route Review</h2>

					<h3>13. Sunohara "Route"</h3>
					<ion-icon class="expandable-icon" name="chevron-back-circle-sharp"></ion-icon>

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\sunohara_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Youhei Sunohara.">
						<p>
							This one doesn't even really count, it's basically cheating to talk about it, but this would feel incomplete if I didn't mention it. The Sunohara route is basically Tomoya failing every female love interest in some way and then going with Sunohara... Even though he's not interested. Tomoya acts out of character and the whole fact that he's gay in this route is meant to be played for a joke... So it really isn't even enjoyable as the joke it's meant to be or as a route since it's not technically one. It is from both a different time and place but still, this is still bad. This is the only route that I would call straight up bad which I guess is a good thing in its own right but, unless you're going for all achievements, this is completely optional which can and should be ignored. I guess the only complement I could give is the effort put in for a joke but; the playtime for this "route" is about 20 minutes and there's a fair amount of "route" exclusive text. I just wish the "joke" was better.

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\ryou_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Ryou Fujibayashi.">
						<p>
							This has to be the weirdest Clannad route, even taking into consideration the Sunohara <s>disaster</s> route. Because this isn't a joke and compared to the other routes, it's just plain odd. This wasn't adapted into the anime and this review of the routes is meant to be enjoyed with at least that much knowledge since Clannad is best enjoyed spoiler free. So, a brief summary is that Kyou gets Ryou to confess to Tomoya despite her feelings for him, just like the Kyou route/OVA. But then, after that it's kind of just Ryou and Tomoya dating and then the route ends. Kyou never gets any closure and I think that's terrible when: 1. Ryou gets closure in the Kyou route and 2. You can still choose to practice kissing with Kyou during the Ryou route and get her ending. The Ryou route really just feels like an afterthought. It ends basically as soon as you make every choice needed to "lock in" to the route, it doesn't have closure for Kyou, and it doesn't have a light orb attached to it. I suppose that's a good thing because, luckily, this route is optional. It still is an official route as the credits play once it's over, and it's not bad per se, "weird" really is the word. I'd recommend going through the hell of it but only after you've gone through the Kyou route and maybe just after completing all the other routes. I guess what I'm trying to say is to treat it like the afterthought it feels like it is.

					<h3>11. Yukine Route</h3>
					<ion-icon class="expandable-icon" name="chevron-back-circle-sharp"></ion-icon>

				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">
					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\yukine_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Yukine Miyazawa.">
						<p>
							I've got to admit, it was a toss up whether this or the next route would be next, but I've opted to put Yukine's route here. That may come as a shock to the anime only readers here but what I think is Yukine's best scene isn't in the visual novel! I'm under the assumption that you've read the VN or watched the anime, not necessarily both so be warned! Spoilers right after this sentence!. The scene where Yukine pretends to be her brother after Tomoya fights the opposing gang leader (an entire plot line that wasn't in the visual novel) and then gets punched is not in the visual novel. Period. The plot line with Yu (the boy who believes that Yukine took his sister) is also expanded quite a bit. In comparison, the Visual Novel route feels quite lacking. I can't say for sure but even if I didn't watch the anime first, I think I'd think the same thing. It's pretty short and Yukine, Sunohara and Tomoya all agreeing that Yu's sister is fine with little to no evidence struck me as a bit odd. I like the chill vibe, especially on the rainy days so the main chunk of what this route is is quite enjoyable, this is by no means bad. I'd consider the Sunohara "route" to be the only bad one. Not only that, but I'd consider the Sunohara and Ryou routes to be the only not good ones as well so the Yukine is the first good route on my list. Pretty impressive all things considered.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything I've said could be passed by in my eyes. And I can't exactly go back in time and play the visual novel before the anime to for sure say that it's good without the bias of having watched the anime first. But, there is one glaring problem I have with the route. First off, for those who just watched the anime, most of the routes have Tomoya ending up in a relationship with the route's character in most cases. The exceptions being Koumura, Mei, Fuko (kind of) and a visual novel exclusive character we'll get to later. That's not really a spoiler since it doesn't affect the story in a major way for the relationships that aren't adapted. The problem is with how this is handled in Yukine's route. It ends with the graveyard scene of the anime, Tomoya sees the light orb, and then he kisses Yukine. She's seen him as a replacement for her brother and that's his way of saying he wants to be seen as more. It's kind of left up to interpretation whether he succeeds or not which is fine and dandy. But it's ruined to me by the fact that there's a "post credits scene" that does nothing more than give lore on the light orbs. I'd be fine if they made their relationship clear during that scene or if it wasn't included, but it feels like a "having your cake and eating it too" type of deal. It is the only time pre After Story where a light orb is seen as physically present rather than a thing that the player gets (kind of, well get to that), but that's actually something I'll get to later. TLDR; this route is good, but it has a lot of flaws and the anime not only fixed them but adapted it better as a whole.

					<h3>10. Baseball Route</h3>
					<ion-icon class="expandable-icon" name="chevron-back-circle-sharp"></ion-icon>

				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">
					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\baseball_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the Visual novel Clannad with the character Youhei Sunohara overlaid with his baseball statistics.">
						<p>
							We love us some sports! Give it up for sports! This is a completely bonus route that is just plain fun so honestly, I had a hard time finding a good place in the order here to put it. I'm still not confident in my choice, I feel like I could put it two spots up and still be content with that choice as much as I am with putting it here. I don't even have anything negative to say about it like I do some of the routes ahead of it. It just doesn't have as much heart as the other routes. This isn't really spoilers, but this route does start a bit differently from how it does in the anime. That's mostly because, since this its own route, Tomoya has to get introduced to all the characters who will be a part of it vs. already knowing them in the anime. Still, if the little bit of what I'm going to say that isn't in the anime bothers you, you can just skip the rest of what I'm going to say for this route. It's short, simple and fun, just like the anime version. If you're an anime only person and still here, I'll now let you in on how this route gets going. Tomoya and Sunohara bum around, trying to starve off boredom, and they eventually decide on laser tag since some "random" guy got Sunohara interested. In the game is Kyou, Tomoyo, Sunohara (who gets out almost immediately), Tomoya and "the mystery man." Tomoya is set on winning since all the losers have to listen to what the winner says. He beats Kyou and Tomoyo, eventually entering a wild-west style quick draw with... Akio Furukawa, the mystery man. It's a tie but since Akio got more people out (apparently there were 20 or so other players who were his fellow business owners), he gets to order around just Tomoya. He orders him to round up a baseball team and things are (mostly) the same as the anime. There is one huge difference though, Kotomi is one of the players in the anime whereas it's Fuko in the visual novel. It's kind of funny when you think about it, since both Fuko and Kotomi's routes had been covered by that point in the anime, it made the most sense to go with Kotomi. In the VN, it was the exact opposite. Since both plots weren't covered in the Baseball route, it made the most sense to go with Fuko.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's cool to see Sanae and Akio (though mostly Akio) interact with the other characters they don't normally interact with as well. I'm a big Misae fan so having her interact with Akio, Tomoyo and Yoshino all in one route was a huge treat for me personally. Having baseball described to you really isn't that enjoyable. Clannad does the best job it can, but this route is all about the character interactions. It's like what Nagisa says about everyone working to common goal. The ending is really great too, you can see what I mean with the image above, but I don't necessarily mean just that. The ending is mostly the same with Tomoya hitting the last ball, but then it doesn't tell you if they score the point they need. Tomoya starts talking about how everyone went their separate ways after that and how we still remembers that day very fondly. Then, the special credits roll with every player's baseball stats. Finally, at the very end, it shows the score and that they won. It's more impactful than the anime, but it's not like the anime could really do that. This route is adapted the best it can be but the VN really has that wonderful extra something. It's fun and I like the characters, this really is a nice bonus and the only optional route that I fully recommend you give a try if you have not already.

					<h3>9. Kyou Route</h3>
					<ion-icon class="expandable-icon" name="chevron-back-circle-sharp"></ion-icon>
				</div>
				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">
					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\kyou_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Kyou Fujibayashi.">
						<p>
							I didn't expect this route to be so low or for it to be such a hard placement to make but here it is. I feel kind of bad putting the Kyou route here because I have a hard time understanding why I don't like it as much as I think I should. First off, Kyou is my second favourite Clannad character which is an impressive feat. It's probably because she appears so often in the anime and the visual novel. She's one of the heroines in the VN that you have to meet outside her routes so combined with her personality, she really makes an impact. Maybe the Kyou route subconsciously disappointed me. Most of the time spent at the start is Tomoya dating Ryou which is a bit better than the anime since Tomoya really wants to put his best foot forward in dating Ryou. When Tomoya and Kyou having feelings for each other is more apparent, they spend even more time apart. It really feels like they should have spent more time as a couple, but I can also understand why that didn't happen, it just wouldn't really work. It also doesn't really feel satisfying as a Ryou route since it ends up being pretty obvious that Kyou likes Tomoya not long in, especially if you've played other routes beforehand. I still enjoyed it, I really did, but it didn't feel as satisfying as the other routes in this VN. To be honest, I think my thoughts could be represented by the last character graphic of this route. It's of Kyou kissing Tomoya, but her hair is short, so she looks like Ryou. It feels like it was supposed to be a route for the twins, but they had to give one a happy ending with the main character and as a result, feels unbalanced.
						</p>
						<p>
							I feel like I've talked too much about what I don't like, so what do I like? The great writing of Clannad is here of course and this route actually has my second favourite Sunohara moment of all time. Seeing him be serious is always a treat so him telling Tomoya that he seriously has to pick one of the girls and hurt one of them as a result hits a great emotional beat. Him refusing to kiss Kyou since he knows she's not doing out of love is great too, it really reminds you that he's a good person in spite of everything he does. I also really Ryou and Tomoya's conversation near the end, it feels really mature and is a great bit of closure for her. The fact that they made sprites for Kyou with her hair halfway grown was really cool too. They really just could have said that her hair grew all the way back but no, that little bit of extra effort was put in. Overall, I really like this route but not as much as I feel I should. And even after voicing my complaints, I feel as though there's something that makes me not like it as much as the others that I can't put my finger on.

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\koumura_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Toshio Koumura.">
						<p>
							I think this route is the definition of "short but sweet." Almost all the early parts of this route are needed to do for the Nagisa route and when you get to the Koumura stuff, it's really short. But there's nothing wrong with that, especially when you need to go through 10 routes to get to After Story. I also really like the characters in this route. Other than the Nagisa route, this is the only other route where you have to get her and Tomoya to date, so that means more Sanae-san and Akio-sama; characters I love. But we also get Kouko, serious Sunohara and of course, Koumura. Surprisingly, he doesn't get that much screen time, yet it works. It really feels like a route where Sunohara and Tomoya come to terms with their life of carefree idiocy and Koumura is just a natural part of them being able to accept that. Tomoya and Sunohara realizing how much he really meant and what he did for them after they learn he's going to retire and that they're his last "real" students was really amazing. It's simple but impactful, I really don't have much else to say about it. I guess I would recommend you do this route after Nagisa's because it does feel like it's building to her ending but then shifts to Koumura's. It almost feels like it was intended to be in her ending and that's basically how it is in the anime. But it isn't bad as its own route, I just think it could have been expanded on more since it is. I said it works that Koumura doesn't get much screen time but even then, it feels like he should be more present. Maybe a scene where Tomoya gets called to the teachers' room to get yelled at and Koumura tells the teacher yelling at him to go easier would have been nice. It could tie in really well too when Tomoya learns he used to be super strict. Just a neat idea I had. I don't know how to end this section of ramblings so on to the next I guess.

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\kappei_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Kappei Hiiragi.">
						<p>
							"WHO!?" - Anime only Clannad fans. Yeah, this is a character who is completely exclusive to the visual novel so if you haven't read it and want to without spoilers then just completely skip my ramblings for this route. So, if you haven't skipped and are still from the anime only camp, I should probably explain who the hell this guy is. Well, he actually is implied to exist in the anime as he's mentioned, just not by name. That's because he's (drumroll please) ...Ryou's boyfriend! Of course, that's not a shock to the VN readers but the fact that such an important character to Ryou isn't in the anime must be surprising. Ryou really got gypped in the anime since this route is almost as much hers as it is Kappei's. Her actual route might as well be a bad ending for Kyou instead of a Ryou ending so having her have such a big role here is great. To summarize, Tomoya meets Kappei through helping him after he gets hit by Kyou's bike. Kappei is a self-centered but very kind and honest person who keeps fired from various jobs. Tomoya keeps running into him, the two eventually becoming friends. This leads to Kappei eventually meeting with Ryou, the person he fell for after she helped him the first time he got hit by Kyou's bike. They start dating almost immediately. But after a time skip, Tomoya finds out that Kappei is in the hospital for osteosarcoma (bone cancer) in his legs and refuses to get surgery since he used to be a runner and his legs mean everything. Eventually, Ryou is able to convince him and the sad tone but happy ending that Clannad is known for happens. 
						</p>
						<p>
							So that's a summary, but it doesn't really do the route justice, you really should read this one on your own if you haven't already. I think it's the first route that is "great" as opposed to just "good." This is Ryou's time to shine, and it's really nice to see her happy with Kappei especially since it feels like he's her soulmate. Ryou and Kappei blows Ryou and Tomoya out of the water times 100. They start holding hands I think the day they meet again if I recall correctly, and it doesn't seem forced, it seems like this is who she's meant to be with. Kappei is pretty good too, he isn't my favourite character and if they absolutely had to remove a character from visual novel to anime I think I would pick either him or Yukine in all honesty. He's very important to Ryou but Ryou isn't very important to the Clannad anime as a whole, so I suppose it makes sense, even if it is sad that this route was excluded. They did Yukine very well in the anime, but that's what makes it odd. They had to add a good bit of content to Yukine's route to make it as good as it is in the anime, but that wouldn't really have to be the case for Kappei. It could be more impactful in a way since, in the VN, Kappei has Sunohara, Tomoya and, obviously, Ryou as people close to him. I think the more ensemble cast of the anime all trying and failing to convince him to keep living would have made it even better than the VN. Either way, we got what we got and what we got was pretty damn amazing.
						</p>
						<p>
							I do have some gripes with this route though. First is Sunohara... Kind of? Near the start of this route when Kappei and Sunohara meet for the first time, Sunohara thinks that Kappei is a woman. Naturally, Sunohara does his thing and tries to put the moves on "her," much to his misfortune (as always). Eventually, he finds out that Kappei is a guy but here's the thing, he still has feelings for him. It's... Uncomfortable at first. Sunohara uses female pronouns for Kappei and refuses to call him by his first name (a traditionally masculine name in Japan). But, as the route goes on, Sunohara kind of accepts it more? He goes back to using male pronouns and calls him by his first name like once but still doesn't refuse his feelings. It's odd, mostly played for jokes and certainly has homophobic tones. Still, it has a glimmer of hope of sorts that tells me this could have been a pretty good side plot should it have been written 10 or even 5 years later. I genuinely wish my friends enjoyed traditional visual novels more because I would love to see if they see that same hope or if I'm on that good copium. Anyway, I have two other (smaller) things that I don't like about this route, one at the beginning and one at the end. The way you enter this route is kind of dumb. You have to get to the scene where Kyou is about to hit Tomoya with her bike. When you do, there are three options: Jump left, Brace for impact and Jump right. In every scenario, Jump left and Brace for impact have no impact on any route but, to be introduced to Kappei (and thus, be able to start his route) you have to Jump right. With a guide, this doesn't matter at all but imagine you're playing without one or if you were playing it not long after it came out. It's mostly a nitpick but enough of one for me to bring it up. My other (I think slightly less so) nitpicky thing is something mentioned near the end. As mentioned earlier, Kappei has cancer, a great tug-at-the-heartstrings moment when the characters find out. It's what comes after that, to me, is the only time Clannad tries too hard at being sad; Kappei is also an orphan. I just felt like it was unnecessary and even artificial sadness. It doesn't really add anything. If they wanted a better explanation as to why Kappei was a drifter then I think him being on bad terms with his family could have been better. I think that could make it more sad when Tomoya, who relates, can't convince him to keep living. I don't mind how it played out, but I feel even not mention he was an orphan at all would have worked better too since it's crucial. Either way, this is still a great route with minimal flaws and really should have been adapted.

						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\misae_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Misae Sagara.">
						<p>
							MISAE!!!! I really like hit character Misae Sagara from hit visual novel Clannad made by hit company Key. Jokes aside though, she is one of my favourite characters. The "tired 'old' women" characters have always appealed to me; Shizuka Hiratsuka from the anime OreGairu is in the same realm. Unlike anime though, VNs have the option to be with the tired old women and Clannad in no exception! This is a fairly short route, and it's what I would call an "inaction route." What I mean by that is that choices to get to Misae's route are always there but often, you enter another route before you can get to all of her options. So what you have to do is ignore the other girls to get it. That's not a bad thing but combined with the shortness and something I'll get to later, this route feels... Different. Not in a bad way but I certainly wouldn't say it's the case in a good way either. Having the first half of this route being Tomoya and Misae chilling in her room is really cool. It's like having that smaller scale (compared to the other routes, anyway) is because she's older and doesn't really want to run around a school or around town. This is really the only route where Tomoya actively goes for the girl which makes it different enough from the anime without actually having unneeded plot differences. There's also a scene where Tomoya gets Nagisa (or Ryou, but I got the Nagisa scene) to ask Misae for love advice. This is so he can learn more about "the boy from the past" and I think that has to be the best pre-backstory scene from her route. It's the only time when another love interest professes their love for Tomoya and doesn't end up with him which makes it particularly interesting to me. 
						</p>
						<p>
							All of that is nice, but it is not the meat and potatoes of the Misae route. The backstory section where you go through the perspective of another character for the only time really makes this route special. There's no Tomoya, just Misae, her two friends and temporary new protagonist Katsuki Shima. I know there is some confusion as to how (or what) Shima is, but I actually think the whole mystical aspect of this route is easily explained. Misae, when visiting her mother at the hospital, encountered a man named Katsuki Shima and spoke to him. What she said doesn't matter, the fact that she spoke to him made him quite happy. This man died and, as his dying wish, he entrusted his cat to fulfil a wish of Misae's with a light orb. Somehow, this gave the cat human form and this cat used Katsuki Shima's name. This human cat forgot everything except the fact he had to make sure Misae got her wish. But, because of Misae's hardheadedness and cat Shima wanting to give her a proper wish, they hang around with each other for a while. Misae falls in love with Shima and finally decides she wants her wish to be with Shima forever. Shima goes to grant the wish (remembering who he really is by this point) but sees the light orb is not in his little satchel, implying that Misae's wish had already been granted some time ago. The next day, Shima is forced back into his cat form and follows Misae around, Misae only realizing it's him when she plays with him at the Founders Festival, something they promised to do when they were together. Maybe I lied about it being simple haha... But I hoped that helped for those who were confused, I think my interpretation is mostly correct (maybe with the exception of the fact that cat Shima was a cat beforehand). It really sounds like a crazy story, and it is but a good chunk of it is subtext, and it isn't all thrown at you at once as you probably know. I love this section of the route, it's really amazing, and it shows that Tomoya isn't needed in every story. This route also has the most surreal aspects since this story is told through the framing that Shima the cat sends this story to Tomoya through a dream. It's interesting to have the mystical elements so prevalent in only this route; I think it was a good choice.
						</p>
						<p>
							I've sung the praises of this route and that may be because I like Misae so much, but I do have some problems with it. Tomoya going after Misae so quickly is weird, it's a bit jarring how fast it happens. I don't mind the short routes, but this one suffers for it a little. The non-Shima ending is also just a bit odd. Tomoya talks to cat Shima and says something like "you want me to tell her about that dream" and then it kind of ends there. I think it's fairly obvious that Tomoya doesn't end up with Misae as her love is still around but ending it there is weird. Of course, if you've read the VN you know that the true ending to her route is actually placed part way through Tomoyo's route... I don't like this choice at all. You can complete the routes in any order except Misae's (unless you're going for all achievements, but that's neither here nor there). Well, that's not completely true. You can still do Tomoyo's first, but you have to go through it again up to the Misae section after you've completed her route anyway. The Misae stuff in Tomoyo's route is amazing as always; it gives her the closure she needs as it's where she finds out that her cat is the person she fell in love with. The problem is you don't get that happy ending in her own route which is super weird. I think a better way that it could have been done is like this: Tomoya understands that he will never be the one for Misae and gives up. He still wants to tell her about the dream but is a bit unsure on how to go about it. He decides to ask her to the Founders Festival under the pretext that he wants at least one date since he decided to give up. She agrees, Shima gets "lost" before they leave, so they spend their date looking for him, eventually finding him and then playing out like it does in Tomoyo's route. I can't remember if the dates line up, but it wouldn't be a big issue to fix if they don't. I certainly think that this route would be down one or two spots if I didn't like Misae so much but this route is genuinely great, amazing in its backstory section. It's the best of the short routes in my option, it just more glaring flaws than other routes, especially with it's very very very very odd structure.

					<h3>5. Mei Route</h3>

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\mei_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Mei Sunohara.">
						<p>
							The real Sunohara route was the friends we made along the Mei. I have not pulled such a groaner in a while, but I just had to when I thought of it. Anyway, this route is amazing. This is almost as much about Youhei Sunohara as it is Mei Sunohara and that's wonderful. I did this route near the end of my reread, and it was super satisfying getting a lot of serious Sunohara moments in one route after a bunch of him getting kicked around at whatnot with serious moments sprinkled in. Mei is cool too. She's by no means my favourite character, but she serves the role she was given perfectly; the capable younger sister to the idiotic older brother. It's more of a medium length route and although length doesn't equate to quality, I actually do feel that is the case for Clannad. All the longer routes are near perfect so since this one being longer helps it quite a bit. You really get a feel for how worried Mei is about her brother, the feelings from her, Sunohara and Tomoya feel genuine. It was a bit weird when Tomoya and Mei were pretending to date. It wasn't egregious or anything, but I feel like they could have played it down just a tad; make it feel more like they're on a fake date. At the end of it too when Mei wants to kiss Tomoya. Even though it was just the cheek, I think it would have been better if she noticed her brother there and have that be the reason why she wanted to kiss him. Still though, Sunohara pretending to not care because he had Sanae and trusted Tomoya was brilliant. And Mei catching balls for the Soccer team, so her brother could play just hurt so much in the way that Clannad is known for. Not to mention the fight. Sunohara running in at the last second to save his sister and then fighting with Tomoya is my favourite fight in all of visual novels and maybe all of anime, including Shōnen. It really is just so impactful, the anime version introduced me to the very concept of slice-of-life fight scenes, and they might be one of my favourite things in anime when they crop up.
						</p>
						<p>
							An interesting (but necessary) change is that, in the VN, Mei stays at Tomoya's house in her route, Nagisa's in her route and with Misae in every other route you talk to her in. Technically, it's not a full change as basically merged her route with her spending time with Nagisa. Not a big deal, but I thought I would mention it. We also get Sanae in Mei's route in the VN. She's a new character to Tomoya and Sunohara because of that, but it's cool to see her. It shows how powerful she can be since, even without Nagisa to make them meet, she's still just as kind as ever. Having her give advice to Tomoya about what to do about Sunohara was a really great moment, Sanae really is a great character even when she's out of her normal environment of the bakery. That moment of when Tomoya and Sunohara first met tying in with their fight together was brilliantly done as well. I do wish they made a sprite for Sunohara with some bandages and bruises for that moment, but it's not a big deal at all. One thing that is a slight bit more of a big deal is the post credits scene. It's of Sunohara finding out Sanae was married, and it's a fine and practically required scene, but it does take a bit of steam out of the ending. Still though, we're reaching the point where routes are getting close to perfect. There are some issues, but they're not large, and the story is fantastic, there's a reason it's in my personal top 5.

					<h3>4. Tomoyo Route</h3>
					<ion-icon class="expandable-icon" name="chevron-back-circle-sharp"></ion-icon>

				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">
					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\tomoyo_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Tomoyo Sakagami.">
						<p>
							Tomoyo Sakagami is probably the most iconic Clannad character aside from the mains Nagisa and Tomoya. I mean, an entire VN dedicated to her is pretty crazy, I didn't really expect any character to get that. I guess she makes sense though. She's right up there with Nagisa and Kyou in terms of character popularity and I think that, of the two who don't have an After Story of their own, Tomoyo had the most room to be expanded on. I've yet to read through Tomoyo After at the time of writing this, but it shouldn't affect my opinions on this route. So, on to this route. Tomoyo is one of the characters you will almost definitely meet in the VN before you go through her route. The stuff with her beating up Sunohara is all route non-exclusive and some of it can even be skipped when trying to get her route. I think the Sunohara stuff is alright, some of it is genuinely kind of funny and some of it not. The later sections of Tomoya, Tomoyo and Sunohara meeting in the halls, so he can try some scheme are better because they focus more on Tomoyo and Tomoya talking. Character interactions are something that Clannad excels at, after all. When finally transitioning into the route itself, I think having Tomoyo waking up Tomoya and Sunohara was pretty cool. It sounds weird, but her personality makes it work. Then, when you combine that with the fact that she most definitely has feelings for Tomoya by that point, she makes something that would be ridiculous to do, completely normal. When they do start dating, we get another unique perspective on relationships in a basic but realistic way. Tomoyo and Tomoya are the only couple who are physically lovey-dovey in a casual way. All the other pairings are either different in some way or have the characters become a couple at the end of the route, so this is a seemingly basic thing that's made special by its rarity. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This route also heavily focuses on Tomoya's situation in life in a way that no other route does. The future really matters here, it's the main conflict of this entire route. Of course, it's something that matters in After Story, but it isn't an issue per se. Tomoya doesn't really care as long as he works and gets things done by his own two hands because he knows that will make him and Nagisa happy. Tomoyo's route poses the question of "what if that scenario harmed the love interest's future." The way it's handled is really devastating too. Everything starts going to hell when Tomoyo and Tomoya almost have sex in a classroom. They both consent, but it feels like they're both doing it for the wrong reason. Tomoyo ignoring the fact that she knows it's dangerous and will make it impossible to achieve her goal of becoming student council president and saving the cherry blossom trees for her brother. And Tomoya feels like he's doing it knowing that same thing but wanting to stay with Tomoyo anyway. It all just feels wrong in the best story telling way possible as all of that isn't outright stated. In terms of tone, Tomoyo and Tomoya getting caught during that moment, and Tomoya threatening the person who catches them to save Tomoyo from any guilt might be the heaviest moment in all of Clannad. One that's not heavilty emotional, anyway. It's accentuated by the fact that Clannad was the first Key made visual novel to not be 18+ when it first released and was surrounded by 18+ visual novel releases. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Another section of this route that just hurts so good is the section when Tomoyo and Tomoya are working through the rumors. Tomoya really just struggles in a way that he never has before with the fact that he's dragging down Tomoyo. And Tomoyo just ignores them despite her knowing that they'll affect her chances of becoming student council president. It all comes to a head when Tomoya talks to a person on the student council by chance. He point-blank says things how they are with no fear. He wants to see the heights that Tomoyo will reach, and he clearly says that Tomoya is dragging her down; something that Tomoya knew but needed to hear to do something about. And so, he breaks up with Tomoyo. The main character breaks up with the main love interest, it's really unique for Clannad and something you don't expect when you first start the route. Of course, they get back together but it's months later in universe, after Tomoyo achieves her goal. It was something she had to do, but she lost something just as (maybe even more) important in the process. It's a really adult scenario. The route ends on a nice upbeat tone too, Tomoyo makes her brother and Tomoya happy in the end, the two of them even meeting and getting along. I'd also like to mention that the scene where the teacher is lecturing Tomoya about Tomoyo and just saying everything he knows is great as well, I love it. Overall, the route is fantastic with the only flaw being Misae's little section being in here when it should have been all in her route. But I feel that affects Misae's route more than it does Tomoyo's. Even if you've watched the OVA, 20 or so minutes can't cover this route so read it if you haven't, it's great.

					<h3>3. Fuko Route</h3>

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\fuko_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Fuko Ibuki.">
						<p>
							I think Fuko's route is the saddest in Clannad. Full stop. Looking at it in a vacuum, it has the saddest ending. Fuko's voice does end up reaching her sister, sure. But everyone forgets about her. Not only is it the saddest ending, it's sad in a more cosmic sort of way. Nobody wants to be forgotten after they die and that's exactly what happens to Fuko. Well, pre After Story anyway. But that gap of time between Fuko's route and her fate there vs. her actual, happier fate is truly heartbreaking. It's still really sad too since she's still not remembered. I think the visual novel even pushes it a bit further in terms of sadness. If you don't know, in the anime, Nagisa and Tomoya are the last ones who remember Fuko. They share that moment together where they're all in the empty classroom at night with Fuko and her party set. But in the VN, it's just Tomoya. Nagisa is the second to last one to remember Fuko but in the end, it's just Tomoya. It's like a "last two people on Earth" kind of scenario. The visual novel is also interested in the aspect that Fuko's route is the only one to have two good endings! If Tomoya opts to not get with Nagisa, you have the option to kiss Fuko near the end. It's not a huge difference but very interesting since her route is the only one where something like this is done. I'd personally say date Nagisa and not kiss Fuko though. There's obviously changes in dialogue since one route has Tomoya and Nagisa together and the other doesn't. The thing is, during the non-date version of route, it's kind of like they're dating. There's a moment where Tomoya straight up says he loves Nagisa when they're not dating and nothing really comes from it. It's weird, but I think that actually gives this route the best reason to reread it. There are smaller sections in the VN like Yukine's spells or the basketball game that give you reason to go over them again at least. But Nagisa and Tomoya's relationship combined with Fuko's two endings, that's about a half (maybe a bit less) of a routes worth of rereadability.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, this route is the one with the most mystical elements. Fuko is a "ghost" (I think maybe an astral projection would be the more correct term) with the purpose of making people who have never met her sister go to her wedding by giving them carvings of starfish (which look no different than stars). It sounds absolutely insane but Clannad works its magic. The story is grounded as ever and the slow degrading of peoples' memories as Fuko tries so desperately to make her voice heard is so painful in the best way possible. That moment where Sunohara has forgotten Fuko, but her name slips out and Tomoya comforts him slightly... It's so good... Genuinely a masterpiece in writing. This is the first in the top three of routes for me personally. Normally that number is meant to represent how much one likes something and that's certainly the case here. But it means something else too. On my second play through of Clannad, is this one of three routes that made me cry, tears coming down the face, full on cry. It was right at the end at Kouko's wedding when Tomoya started cry and Kouko starts talking to him. It's just one of those scenes, there are other ones you could certainly say are sadder or more emotional but this one just hit the feelings button. I really don't have anything bad to say about this route, it's the first of three that I can't think of any issues I have with it. Even the comedy is good which I think mostly falls flat or isn't really worth mentioning. Playing pranks on Fuko is fun and most of them are pretty funny and even the one off jokes like Fuko using the name of the neighbors for hers and her being stupefied by the starfish bread are pretty good. All of the emotional beats are hit with great force and even the things Clannad normal falters at are done great. I don't struggle when I say this one of three perfect routes in Clannad; an extremely impressive achievement.

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\kotomi_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the character Kotomi Ichinose.">
						<p>
							To be perfectly honest, this placement surprises even myself. I liked Kotomi, but she was far from my favourite character. I think this is for a couple of reasons. The first is just my first experience with the anime. I mentioned this earlier, but I didn't really like the Clannad anime when I first watched it, not as much as I do now at the very least. So, I took a break from watching it during what Netflix labeled as "season 1" which was the first 12 episodes. That means that I stopped smack dab in the middle of Kotomi's story arc; having it broken up like that when I first watched it made me not like her as much. I also think the anime version of her route looses some of the uniqueness since the anime as a whole is more of an ensemble series, but that's exclusive to Kotomi's route in the VN. Kotomi is also a type of character that I'm not really drawn to, although I know the reason why it is, she isn't personable. I also didn't like her that much when I first went through the VN, which I can't really explain as much, it's just how I felt. But, keep in mind, not liking a character "that much" in Clannad is a whole different world compared to other "not that muches." Every character in Clannad is written amazingly, the routes have been written amazingly and this recent play through of Clannad has enlightened me to that fact for Kotomi's route.
						</p>
						<p>
							Kotomi's route is a genuine masterpiece of writing, I mean that in all honesty. Kotomi is a really weird character, but that's the point; she's in an entire different world from Tomoya in a way that no other character is. That dynamic is also done in Tomoyo's route but in a very different way. In Tomoyo's route it's more about what she can achieve and how that makes her different from Tomoya. In Kotomi's route, it's about how intelligent she is and how that makes her different from every one else but with a focus on Tomoya since he's the main character and because of their past together. Speaking of, that's done very well... I think? By that I mean that I think it's not too obvious that they have a past together, but it's always hard to make a judgement on things like that with hindsight. At the very least, I can be fairly certain on saying that you'd never predict how they're involved before it's outright stated. I think this could be the best use of the "childhood friend" trope in visual novel history for two reasons. The first is that you don't know Kotomi is Tomoya's childhood friend in the other character's routes, so that subverts the trope (though, to some degree Kyou is an inheritor of said trope). And the second is that Kotomi being Tomoya's childhood friend is important to the plot in a way that isn't related to the romance between them. The romance is secondary (maybe even tertiary), all you need to do is watch the anime to find that out. It's very well done and part of the creativity of Clannad.
						</p>
						<p>
							Kotomi's story with her parents, her parents' colleagues and Tomoya as a child is incredible, amazing, fantastic... Words don't do it justice, but I'll try my damnedest. It all starts from the very beginning, the concept of a friend group. As I mentioned earlier, this is the only route that actually has that ensemble aspect. It's kind of in the baseball route, but that's more of a bunch of people who know each other. Here, it's 5 characters with various histories with each other coming together and becoming friends. It sounds so simple, but it feels heaps more special than the anime since it kind of had to be formatted as an ensemble series to some degree. I like both just about equally but the format of each makes this concept inherently more interesting in the VN. It also eventually leads to one of the most harrowing scenes in all of Clannad. Nagisa delivers news that Ryou could have been in a car crash and Kotomi just breaks down. It's visceral, it's disturbing, and it's just so real. The way it's described and the way it's depicted in the anime make it so hard to read/watch in the good way. I genuinely want to make a short video or something like that on the scene in the visual novel vs. the scene in anime because both have slight differences that I think punctuate the strengths of each medium. Tomoya's struggle to try and help Kotomi along with Kyou, Ryou and Nagisa's own struggle both hit super hard. It's hard to describe but Kotomi ending up with Tomoya in the VN and not so in the anime both work excellently. And god that ending... It brought me to tears. It's perfect, it ties in with everything, and it's the perfect culmination to Kotomi as a character. My only potential issue is the suitcase being found on Kotomi's birthday by happenstance, but that's like a needle in a haystack of wonderful writing. Read it if you haven't, watch it if you haven't, Kotomi's route is a masterclass in writing and something that needs to be experienced.

						<img class="center round" src="images\clannad\vn\nagisa_screenshot_2.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with the characters Nagisa Furukawa and Tomoya Okazaki.">
						<p>
							Nagisa's route is Clannad. Well, pre After Story Clannad anyway. I mean, she's the only one who gets an After Story in the first place (Tomoyo excluded!)! Except for Tomoya's dad and Yoshino Yusuke, all of the characters who get story arcs in After Story are related to Nagisa in some way. Her route is also the one that gets adapted in the movie and is the main focus of the anime. In some ways, she's more of a main character then Tomoya, but he still wins out. I love Nagisa, she's so sweet and timid, and I really think she's the most deserving of the character to be followed the most. Some of the elements of her route are often required for other routes (take needing to date Nagisa in Koumura's route for example). I'd say that makes her route lose a little bit of its luster, but it's just so great that I think it's a non issue. It can also be alleviated by doing the route first anyway. Tomoya helping Nagisa with the drama club starts off as something that you could easily be mistaken as hating him for, but slowly you get to see him genuinely want to help Nagisa. It takes a while, but they do fall in love, and it has to be the strongest of all the romances in this visual novel. Tomoya lives for Nagisa, and it's clear in this route and especially in After Story how much of an effect each character has had on the other.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm really fond of the way Tomoya asks Nagisa out. I'm a real big cheese ball when it comes to romance and the like and Tomoya says something like "wouldn't it be cool if we woke up tomorrow and were boyfriend and girlfriend." It's a very childish way of saying, and it's very cheesy, but that's what makes me love that moment even more. Of course, Nagisa and Tomoya dating means we get to see a lot of Akio and Sanae! They might be my favourite parent characters in all of fiction, they're just so great. Their reason for protecting Nagisa so much is also so realistic and so sad, they could have a visual novel of their own if you ask me. I think I'd also be remiss to not mention the major difference between this route compared to its anime counterpart. Nagisa and Tomoya date much later in the anime, they start at the end of Clannad's first season and during a completely different story moment. In the VN, it's when Nagisa starts crying because the drama club probably won't be formed and in the anime it's much later when they return to the clubroom and Nagisa finds the love umbrella on the chalk board. Quite a jump of time between them but it makes sense considering the circumstances.
						</p>
						<p>
							There's just so many great moments in Nagisa's route that it's unreal. The scene with Nagisa and Tomoya in the rain, the confession scene (as I mentioned earlier), the basketball game. Actually, I'd like to linger on the basketball game for a bit. It's a fascinating little section of the VN. In the anime, they get the third player to be Kyou but in the VN she's just one of the choices. Some of the choices get you a bad ending, but you can still win the game with the characters you'd expect to be athletic (Kyou, Tomoyo, Yoshino, etc.). It's a little bonus thing to do like Yukine's magic spells. And back to the best moments of this route, Nagisa finding out about her parents giving up their dreams for her sake is so sad in an ethereal sort of way. She keeps on trying to live like normal, but it's just so upsetting. In the days prior, Nagisa wouldn't properly respond to Tomoya because she was so focused on her script. It was a pretty neat moment but when the exact same thing happens after she finds out about her parents, it makes that moment even more powerful. And, of course, when Nagisa gets up on stage... Oh man, I can still hear Akio yelling to her. I think the anime version tops it but the VN is no slouch, it's the origin of the moment in the first place after all.
						</p>
						<p> 
							Personally, I say that Kotomi's route might top this route because of how truly amazing both. But, I think Nagisa's route embodies what Clannad is as a whole more, that being the relationship between Tomoya, Nagisa and her family. Kotomi has a lot of that, there's family stuff, there's interpersonal stuff and there's relationship stuff. Yet, it's not really the same. The parent dynamic is way different, being more about how Tomoya deals with a normal family since he didn't have one of his own and how Nagisa deals with thinking she's a burden to her parents. The interpersonal stuff is mostly just between Tomoya and Nagisa with other characters (i.e. Sunohara and your basketball partner of choice) being more important to the plot rather than the characters. And, when it comes to their relationship, it's just plain more important. I mean, all of After Story hinges on it. It may sound like I'm putting down on Kotomi's route, but I really don't intend to. Those are just my reasons as to why Kotomi's route is less "Clannad" than Nagisa and, thus, is number two as opposed to number one. Either way, Nagisa's route is truly amazing, but there is one "route" that tops it.

						<p>
							Sound the cheater alarm because I am super ultra cheating with this one! Clannad After Story <i>is</i> Clannad. Without it, I'd say Clannad would still have been a well above average visual novel that would be loved, yes, but it wouldn't have the reputation it still does today. I'm not sure how many of you reading have gone through the two Great Ace Attorney games, but long story short, they're two games but the sequel is so direct that it feels like one game. Clannad and Clannad After Story kind of feel like they have that relationship, but they were never different games to begin with. There's not a huge jump in quality, but it feels like After Story is more... Refined, I guess. I think the linearity really did it some good since everything only had to be focused on one continuing story (for the most part). Technically, After Story does have a route with Akio, but I honestly think it makes more sense to rate it as a whole. There's also story arcs so, for this purpose, I could have divided and ranked After Story that way. But that makes less sense to me, especially since these arcs are only named in the save text, likely only being there to give the player a general idea of where they last left off. 
						</p>
						<p>
							There's so much to say about After Story, it's so full of great moments. The start of it really just sets the scene. Tomoya works for the bakery while trying to make Nagisa happy when she's not at school. I know I've said this before, but it just feels so real, and it gets even more real when Tomoya gets his job with Yoshino Yusuke. It really reminds that yes, Tomoya has now graduated, but he's still young, there's plenty of time to make mistakes and learn from them. He also got his job because he wanted to move in with Nagisa, something that comes to fruition. Things are going pretty well in his life, the only real big misstep is him making a mistake on the job and missing the Founder's Festival with Nagisa, but that still ends in a mostly happy way. Even when things (seemingly) get to their lowest point with Tomoya not getting further in his job due to the incarceration of his father, they pick right back up again with the marriage of Tomoya Okazaki and the newly named, Nagisa Okazaki. Naturally, married life brings new struggles, new love and new feelings which lead to new life.
						</p>
						<p>
							Nagisa wishes to have a child and Tomoya agrees. But, Nagisa's health is obviously a big factor. Throughout her entire pregnancy, it's something that weighs heavily on Akio, Sanae and Tomoya. There's the question of Nagisa should have the child in the first place, but they all know the truth, Nagisa wants to have that child. As someone who never had to go through that kind of thing, it still comes off as really heavy material, so I can only imagine what it would be like for someone who is/has been in that situation. It's genuinely one of the hardest parts of the visual novel to get through, and it doesn't get any easier. If, somehow, for some reason, you're still reading this without having finished either the VN or the After Story anime then I really, really, really, <i>really</i> recommend that you do that right now. I'm not going anywhere, and it's something you shouldn't have spoiled for you which is something I'll be doing in the next paragraph.
						</p>
						<p>
							After giving birth to their daughter, Ushio Okazaki, Nagisa passes away. Yes, in this silly, charming, cute, sad but always-with-a-happy-ending visual novel, one of the main character dies. The character who's had a bad lot in life for most of her life, the character who is the most optimistic, the character who has the most faith in humanity, the character who deserves her fate the least, dies. Nagisa's death, to me, is the most upsetting death in fiction. It's the first time I feel like Clannad transfers from just "sad" to plain cruel. And, want to know something? I love it. Well, "love" sounds like the wrong word in this case, but I think you understand what I mean. I did not want Nagisa do die, and I certainly didn't expect it when I first watched through the anime but... It works. The tragedy of Nagisa's death leads to the best story beats in Clannad, maybe even in all of visual novels. Even just thinking about what happens as I'm writing this makes me a bit anxious, nervous, happy, sad, upset, forlorn... Basically every single one of the emotions that Clannad has evoked at some point and that's just from thinking about it. I know I'm rambling and going on but Clannad is something that begs me to do that, I can't describe it otherwise... It just means so much to me. Before I get back into describing what happens and how I feel about it, I just want to share an experience that I'm not sure if other people have experience. Have you ever watched or read something that hits you so hard that you actually have to stop? Like, you just have to stop experiencing it because it's too much? That's happened to me more than once with After Story. It's happened with other things too but Clannad is the hardest hitter by far. I just thought I'd share that since it's such an interesting thing to go through.
						</p>
						<p>
							After Nagisa's death, Clannad has its first major time skip which is interesting and very, very, very sad. Tomoya basically becomes his father but even worse, it's more like he becomes how he sees his father as opposed to how his father actually is. Nagisa's fate was definitely the cruelest, but Tomoya's isn't exactly much better; it's truly a horrible and ironic twist of fate. For five years he is like this, leaving his daughter Ushio with her grandparents Sanae and Akio. It's natural that one would sympathize with Tomoya but what he does is pretty horrible too, forcing them to raise the child who was the cause of death of their only daughter... Writing it in such plain English for the first time is making me realize it's even worse than I originally thought too. This part of After Story really beats you down relentlessly. But, Clannad does its thing and slowly lifts you up from such an experience. One day, Tomoya is forced on a trip with his estranged daughter. He kind of sucks throughout, but you can see he's at least trying somewhat. But, on that trip, he meets a family member who tells him about when he was younger and all the things his father would do to make him happy, even after the death of his own wife. It's such a simple thing but sometimes a simple thing is all that's needed. It's that moment that makes him want to have a connection with his daughter, even going so far as to tell her about Nagisa, something Sanae and Akio wouldn't do. Clannad really knows how to lift me up high just as hard as it beats me down. 
						</p>
						<p>
							For a while, we get to just see how Tomoya adjusts to raising a child and, after everything that happened, it's pretty lighthearted and fun. We even get to see Kyou again! She's Ushio's kindergarten teacher, a nice call back because that's something that she said she wanted to be back in the non-After Story part of Clannad. We also get to see another, even more interesting, familiar face. That being, Fuko! Instead of seeing her as a weird ghost (but not really a ghost), she has actually woken up from her coma and is significantly older than in Clannad. Well, physically at least. She's still the same old Fuko that we love, becoming friends with Tomoya again and Ushio for the first time. It's all lighthearted as I mentioned, but there's a sadness to it to. This is the same Fuko that <i>we</i> remember, but Tomoya's memories aren't regained after seeing her once again. Still, her silliness keeps things upbeat and that sadness isn't something I was thinking about too hard when reading through. Naturally, we get to see a bit of Kouko as well because of this, but that's kind of it, no other returning characters which surprised me a bit when first watching and reading. Not a big problem but something certainly worth mentioning.
						</p>
						<p>
							Remember how two paragraphs ago I mentioned that Clannad is great at lifting and beating? Well GOLLY does it ever beat. It turns out that Ushio has the same illness as her mother had, making her constitution very weak as well. Just like Nagisa, Ushio becomes sick for months on end. It takes its toll on Tomoya but, also just like Nagisa, he takes care of her to the very best of his ability. He promised to take her on a trip one day when she gets better but, on a day when Ushio is feeling a bit better (but still very sick), Tomoya caves and starts going on a trip with her anyway. Not so fun fact, I lied. I lied about Nagisa's death being the most tragic in fiction for me. Because Ushio dies. Not only does Ushio die, she dies in the arms of her father. Her father who was just getting to know her. Her father who also had to cope with the death of her mother. It's so... Unnerving. It doesn't even feel real, but it is (yes, it is. I'll get to why people might say it isn't later). If you're an anime only watching reading this (or someone who's crazy enough to read this without watching the anime or reading the visual novel), I've got something that will probably surprise (and likely upset) you. That's how the visual novel ends. Well, I'm being a bit loose with my words. To put it in a more accurate way, that's how the visual novel <i>can</i> end.
						</p>
						<p>
							In Clannad, if you do not get all of the orbs of light, After Story ends with Ushio dying. If you didn't know about that or the ending to the anime (or played it before the anime came out), I can only imagine how truly, horribly upsetting it would be to have that be the ending. Of course, that ending is what's widely considered at the bad ending to After Story. The good ending occurs if you get all of the orbs of light. It's also an ending that's hotly debated for its confusing nature and potential deus ex machinainess. But, the ending is actually less complex than people make it out to be. Basically, all of these other world segments that have been scattered around at various points in the VN and anime actually feature Ushio Okazaki in her own world. The purpose of this world is to grant the wish that Tomoya makes after Ushio dies, that being to just be with his family. The illusionary world isn't bound to time and that's how this is possible and how it's possible that Tomoya is born into the world as the junk robot. Through is efforts in the real world (gathering the light orbs) and his efforts in the illusionary world (trying to go back to the real world with Ushio), his wish is granted, and he's taken back to Ushio's birth with one major change. Nagisa lives. I will admit, I can understand why people find it confusing or even a bad ending. I didn't think it was bad when first experiencing Clannad, but it's since grown on me. My only problem is that Tomoya seemingly remembers the 5+ years that happened before getting taken back to Nagisa's birth which is a bit weird but not a dealbreaker at all.
						</p>
						<p>
							So yeah, that's my summary and thoughts on Clannad After Story. Because of the flow of my writing, I didn't really end up touching on Akio's or Yusuke's sections in After Story, but both are incredible. They both touch on darker topics as After Story isn't as shy when it comes to things like that but both end on an upbeat note. Akio's section is also something omitted in the anime. Despite that, I think it's probably the omission that I'm the most okay with. Akio gets a lot of good moments in the anime, from serious to silly he's great. I'd obviously have an arc focused completely on him rather than not, but I'd also not rather that if means making the anime worse. I'd also say this is a good moment to talk about the illusionary world sections in more detail, but I'm still not done with the VN! There are still other things to talk about! So keep reading if you want (or take a break, especially if you've read all of this in one sitting!).

						<p>
							Art is something that's really important for a visual novel. There's no real gameplay in most of them, so the art is what's going to be keeping your eyes busy in between text strings. And Clannad's is... Alright I guess. If you're just reading this part of the website, that's a bit strange. But, if not, you've noticed art from the visual novel throughout. It's nothing bad at all but I could certainly see it being used as an example of the "inbred anime" style (and it most definitely has been used that way). Still though, I've looked at these specific pieces of art for so long that it's kind of hard for me to not like them. Misae's sprites just might be my favourite, she's really cute and the big eyes of her (and all the characters) don't really bother me that much. The anime is still a huge improvement and the After Story anime a huge improvement on top of that. The art style of the character sprites and character graphics could be easily argued as the worst part of Clannad. When you consider that they're alright at worst, that's not a bad thing to have as the worst part of your visual novel.

						<p>
							I'd say it's almost a complete 180 degree turn when it comes to the music of Clannad vs. the art. Almost every track is pure gold and let me tell you, Clannad's is 24 karrat. Out of all the music I've ever listened to, none have ever envoked such a painful emotion as Town, Flow of Time, People. Its so... Words don't even do it justice. If I were to even try to describe it, I guess I would say that it's a song that reminds you of how easily memories are forgotten. And not to mention that the first time you hear it is at the start of the story with Tomoya saying "I hate this town." The music is just what makes me replay that line over and over in my head.
						</p>
						<p>
							And that's just one song. Sure, one of the more noteable songs, but still. There's a whole soundtrack of incredible pieces of music. All of the character themes tell you who the characters are so readily. You could not know a single thing about these characters, but listen to their themes and get a pretty good understanding of who they are. Both Kotomi's and Kyou's themes are probably my favourites, but there's not a single bad one if you ask me. Hell, even if I have some least favourites, I don't think there's a single bad song in the entire visual novel.
						</p>
						<p>
							All of the songs in Clannad just so strongly envoke the emotion they intend to envoke. They make you feel anywhere from 2x-10x to what a normal song can make you feel. It's genuinely incredible. Even the 2 unused songs good as well, which just makes me wonder how many drafts of the used songs there had to be for them to be as good as they are. Honestly, the only bad thing I can say about it is that this is one of those soundtracks that doesn't work as well outside of the context of the visual novel/anime. And when that's the worst thing I can say, that's incredible.

					<h3>Orbs Of Light & The Supernatural Aspects Of Clannad</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">
					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images/clannad/vn/clannad_orb.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad with Tomoya Okazaki's outstretched hand.">
						<p>
							The supernatural aspects of Clannad have always struck me as a bit odd, simply due to how otherwise grounded it is. When you read the visual novel, it's often hours upon hours of slice of life senarios and dialogue with few, if any supernatural elements showing up depending on the route. This actually seems to be the case for Key visual novels, with Kanon being the first thing to come to mind when it comes to mixes of mostly realistic senarios with supernatural elements thrown in.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other than potentially the orbs of light and the other world, Fuko is most surely the most memorable and noteable supernatural element of Clannad. A girl who astral projects out of her comatose body who slowly fades out of the memories of her newly found friends? Geniusly upsetting. Just... Wow... Fuko is just an incredible character as a whole, and her backstory just makes her. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, Fuko isn't the only character with supernatural elements about them, but (once again, ignoring the other world for now) Katsuki Shima is the only other large part of Clannad with a super natural element. In Misae's flashback, he's kind of like Fuko, existing when he shouldn't, but with a goal before he fades away instead of a time limit. But, on top of that, there's Misae's wish (which seems to be an orb of light itself), which not only works, but because of what her wish was, resulted in Katsuki reincarnating as a cat. We also know that as a cat, he was able to show Tomoya the flashback. Super crazy stuff when you put it all together. I personally like Fuko's strange elements more due to being more unique, but both are great.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, the orbs of light... In the visual novel, the definitely just feel like a way to contextualize the completion of all the routes without having to make them all "canon" at the same time, which would be impossible. But, because of the anime, and some (but not all) of the routes, we do know that the orbs of light seen outside of the other world do exist, and are seen by just Tomoya, and later, Ushio. People have a lot of problems with the orbs of light, as they result in the ending of Clannad, which people do find to be a bit of a cheat. Since the rules of them aren't explicitly stated, it only furthers that as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							I personally think that they're pretty good, though better in the context of the visual novel. Their rules are also pretty simple too, and although they're no explicitly stated, I think they're more than clear enough. First, is that only certain people can see them, and they have to be truly good. To me, this is the clearest when Tomoya can no longer see them when Tomoya is sending his father on a trip. The second is not so much a rule, but it's the fact that children are the hopes and dreams of their parents, which is discussed a lot in the series, and is the reason why adult Ushio in the other world can grant Tomoya's wish. Third is very simple, and that's that one has to truly mean their wish. This is made very clear in Misae and Katsuki's backstory. The final rule is that wishes are very literal. This is seen with Tomoya's, where he wants his daughter and wife back, which causes him to be sent back in time instead of bringing them back to life.
						</p>
						<p>
							The orbs of light are an interesting concept, and I do feel they aren't given enough credit. But, at the same time, I can mostly see where people might find issues with them. But since I've written this, and thought on it for some more, the ending isn't really the deus ex machina a lot of fans make it out to be. Other than children being the hopes and dreams of their parents, which doesn't directly relate to the orbs of light, I'd say everytihng is made clear well before Tomoya gets his wish. It honestly just hinges on the fact that Tomoya doesn't know what the orbs of light really are, or what they can do. His daughter in the other world is a bit weird, with Tomoya being the robot and Ushio being grown up. But it all could be seen as a "real metaphor" so to speak, with Ushio and Tomoya getting to the end of the world allowing the wish to come true. There is weirdness, and gaps that do have to be filled in, but my only major issue is Nagisa having some memory of that world, but maybe I'm missing something there.

			<h2>Final Thoughts (On The Visual Novel)</h2>
			<article class="expandable expandable-open">
				<div class="expandable-title">
					<h3>The Masterpiece That Is Clannad</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">
					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images/clannad/vn/vn_boxart.png" alt="Screenshot of the visual novel Clannad's box art.">
						<p>
							As you can probably tell if you've read this far, it's quite hard for me to have a final thought about Clannad. Still, I may as well try my hardest. I guess the first thing of note is that, in spite of it's length, Clannad doesn't feel it's length. Most of the routes are pretty well paced by the time you know you're in them and, as you probably know by my reviews, there really aren't any bad ones. Of course, some are worse than others, but there are so many great ones it's downright scary. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Quality wise, I'd say the music of Clannad has more highs than the routes/stories of Clannad, it's just that the stories of Clannad of much, much <i>much</i> higher highs. Not including the Sunohara "route," there aren't any bad routes, but there are some not-so good ones. But, music wise, I don't even think there's a mediocre song in Clannad's OST, including the 2 unused songs! I'd put the story above the music, even if we're looking at them in a vacuum. But let me tell you, it's a very close fight.
						</p>
						<p>
							The only other aspect to wrap this up with is the art, which is for sure the worst part of Clannad. Personally, I do have a soft spot for Clannad's art, and that era of art as a whole, including visual novels as a whole as well as anime. Speaking from an objective standpoint, I think it would be considered bad, or at least dated. I think the fact that the anime got a completely different artstyle kind of proves this as well. The artstyle even improved itself between seasons of the anime, though that's not too much for proving my point I don't think.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall, Clannad is pretty much the best you can get when it comes visual novels, which is pretty darn impressive considering that there's been 21 years of visual novels following it. I will admit that there have been more groundbreaking, and arguably more interesting visual novels since, especially depending how heavily you weigh the art into your own personal ranking... But as cheesy as it sounds, Clannad just has something that other visual novels, and other pieces of media as a whole, don't have. I've still yet to encounter another piece of media that makes me feel the way Clannad does, and, because of that, it's something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
