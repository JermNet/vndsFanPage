							"So, what is vnds?" That's probably what some- no, most of you are probably asking. Well, vnds is a homebrew program for the Nintendo DS and Android, created by Jake Probst in 2008. As you can probably guess, its sole purpose is to let you play popular visual novels easily on the go. It's... Outdated now, to say the least, and it hasn't been updated in ages. But there's just something about it that strikes me, and it's honestly a really neat time capsule. It also stikes me in the aspect that it has some lost media, which is another personal interest of mine. So, what this page aims to do is basically go in depth as possible when it comes to vnds and it's related content. So, with that said, either filter though the table of contents or just scroll down to learn more about this weird bit of software.

			<h2>The Most Useful Version (If You Ask Me)</h2>
			<article class="expandable expandable-open" id="ds">
				<div class="expandable-title">
					<h3>The Nintendo DS Version</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">
					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/vnds_ds_screenshot.png" alt="Image of the program vnds running Fate/Stay Night.">
						<p>
							As the name suggests, the DS version is the main version of vnds. Personally, I'd also say that it's the most useful as, otherwise, a lot of these visual novels wouldn't be possible on the DS. Some of them most definitely would be, since vnds is very simple, and VNs like Higurashi have actual, proper DS ports. Of course, those never got English versions, so unless you speak Japanese, vnds is your way to go for Higurashi on the go... In, like, 2014 at least. With things like the Switch, and especially the Steam Deck, its been made obsolete. I still like it, though.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are a few different versions of the vnds version, but there are only three that have not been lost to time. Luckily, it's the three most recent versions haven't been lost. As someone who is for archiving old materials, it does upset me a little bit that the older versions are lost. Just as some information as to where I've got this idea from, the only place I could find any DS version is on an archived version of the creators website. I've uploaded the versions to archive.org proper since, and there may be other places on the internet they're uploaded, but if so, they're very hard to find.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the games themselves, it's a slightly better story. Some have been scattered about the internet archive, others are on the porters websites, some are on the vnds website, but the main place I found was a mega link with almost all of them. Still, it didn't have everything, so I've made my own internet archive post with all the vnds novels I could find. Two last things of note are that the difference between the DS novels and the Android novels is resolution, so the DS versions of novels will work on Android, but not the other way around. And the other is that there's no real difference between the basic novels, and the .novel format. The .novel format is just .zip but named differently, basically. You also have converters as well, which depending on the novel, work for both DS and Android, but you need the original PC version of the novel you're converting.

			<h2>A Version "Lost" During My Time With vnds</h2>
			<article class="expandable expandable-open" id="android">
				<div class="expandable-title">
					<h3>The Android Version</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">

							<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/vnds_android_landscape_screenshot.png" alt="Image of the program vnds (Android version) running Tsukihime in landscape.">

						<p>
							In my opinion, the Android version of vnds is much less useful than the DS version. You might be wondering why I'm saying this, as a phone is more convenient and, depending on your phone and DS system, the phone will be smaller. The problem is, there's not a vnds interpreter on the appstore anymore. That's a huge problem for iPhones (which, in defense, I don't know if iPhones ever had a vnds interpreter since I don't own an iPhone), since they're much harder to get external apps on. But it's still a pain for Android, too. The only apk I could find was from a bit of a sketchy website, but after testing it on an Android emulator, it seems to be perfectly okay. The only issue is that it doesn't work on modern Android APIs. The most recent I've found it works on in 26, but I haven't done extensive testing. That's all to say, the Android version is really only useful if you have an old phone lying around.
						</p>
						<p>
							There's not really any point in using the Android version over the DS version anyway. Ignoring the fact that there's not much point to either, the only difference between DS and Android is that Android can handle higher resolution images. As a result, it can play the DS novels as well. The UI is also different too, but you probably could have guessed that. It's still cool, though, and I'd guess so especially back when it would have been more useful, but now, I may be the only one who finds it to be cool. It is one of the things that has gotten me to care so much about archiving stuff, since I remember fondly when it was on the appstore.

							If you've ever tried to make your own visual novel before, you've probably had an encounter with the program Ren'Py. It's probably the easiest way you can make a visual novel in the 21st century... Or is it? I'd 100% say making visual novels with vnds is way easier than Ren'Py. The two issues are that it's horrendously outdated and has so little features to a degree it actually is a problem. Still, if you want to make a vnds novel this is where you want to be. First thing's first, you're going to want to setup your emulators for easy testing. It's more of a pain in the you-know-what for Android to test, but either way, here's a video tutorial for each.

							Now, since vnds games are so simple, there's not too many things that you need to get working. You can even use a normal text editor if you want to, but personally, I wouldn't recommend it. For a text editor, my two biggest recommendations are either VSCode (which I'm using to make this website) or Notepad++. In terms of image editing software, pretty much anything will work as long as you know what you're planning to do. If you want to make a vnds original, you'll be making all the assets yourself, and likely have a photo editing software yourself. But, if you want to make a port, you'll need the assets of the original game, and to resize them (I use a web editor called BeFunky). To get said assets, The Spriters Resource is great, and there's a Ren'Py extractor I'll list with everything else. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Then, there's audio stuff. You're going to need Audacity, simply to change the sample rate depending on the piece of audio. In terms of sounds, I haven't been able to get libfaac working with ffmepg, and the default aac encoder with FFmpeg (which you need aac files for sound effects in vnds) makes the sound come out crusty, but sound effects aren't 100% required. Though, if anyone has a fix, it would be appreciated (feel free to comment on any of my vnds videos). There's also 2 specific made vnds aac converters, but the one of them that has been archived doesn't work. Still, I'll link it just in case.
						</p>
						<p>
							vnds also comes with a "script_format.txt" file which, although doesn't cover everything, covers most of the things you will need to understand the syntax of vnds. On top of that, there's a GitHub wiki page which does cover everything, which has a whole host of links and tools which are more than helpful for this. One specific one that I will link my own download to is a vnds script checker. It's in beta, but the full release stopped working so it's pretty much you're only option other than filtering through your scripts by hand.

				<div class="expandable-content-wrapper">
					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/01_format.png" alt="A screenshot of file explorer with the file structure of a vnds game.">
						<p>
							So, this is what the file structure of vnds game looks like. All of these files and folders are in a folder which can be called whatever you like, and then that folder is in the "novels" folder of vnds. Now, some of these are self explanatory and some are not as much. The "background" folder contains all background images. vnds looks in here (and all folders) automatically when loading a background, but you have to specifiy a path if it's anywhere else. 
						</p>
						<p>
							You don't ever have to touch the "save" folder, as it's generated automatically the first time you save. The "script" folder contains all script files, which are ".scr" (screensaver) files, but for all intents and purposes, may as well be text files. The "skin" folder is optional, and contains styles of how your specific VN can look. The styles are just pngs, with all the large menus being an image each, and smaller buttons being as one image interpreted by vnds. vnds itself comes with a template skin to help make skinning easier.
						</p>
						<p>
							The "sound" folder is, as expected, for sounds. I'll get into the details of that, and everything else, but that's all you need to know for now. "default.ttf" is the font the VN uses, and has to be named exactly that. "icon.png" and "thumbnail.png" are both images use as previews within vnds (and not the novel itself). Finally, "info.txt" simply contains a line for specifying the title of your VN as it will be displayed in vnds (title=Title of VN).

						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/02_text.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how text works.">
						<p>
							Okay, so text is about as simple as you can get. If you want text to appear on the screen, all you have to do is write the word "text" followed a space and then what words you want to be said. Yeah, there aren't even characters who can "speak" like in Ren'Py, so extremely basic. The second line is pretty simple as well, that line will show immediately after line one, without a button press needed to advance the text. The third line is just no text at all, but a button press needed to advance it, and the fourth is the same but without a button press needed to advance as well. It's all super simple stuff, but that's what makes it work so well.

						<p>
							Cleartext is even more simple than just plain text. As the name suggests, it's for, well, clearing text, which appears on the bottom screen in vnds. If you just use the word "cleartext" it fills the bottom screen with enough blank lines to clear the screen. If you follow "cleartext" with an exclamation mark, then it clears the entire history of text, not just "pushing" the text on screen upwards. And, that's pretty much it for cleartext!

						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/04_bgload.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how bgload works.">
						<p>
							To start off with, background images should fit the resolution of the Nintendo DS exactly, that being 256 by 192 pixels. Anything else, and you'll run into issues. They should also be either pngs or jpgs. An important note in terms of loading is that bgload clears all sprites, so you have to load them again after a bgload. To actually load images, it's just the word "bgload" followed by the image name including file type. As mentioned before, you also have to specify the directory if it's anywhere other than the root "background" folder. Finally, if you follow the image name by a space and an integer, that represents the time in frames the image will fade in with. The default is 16, and the DS runs at 60 frames per second.

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/05_setimg.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how setimg works.">
						<p>
							Using setimg is much like using bgload, with a few key differences. First is that it probably works how you expect, not wiping the screen, and letting multiple setimg sprites on screen at the same time. setimg sprites should also only be in png format and be less than 256 by 192 pixels. Those numbers after the image also work differently, as you can't select a fade time for sprites. Instead, it's a location on the screen for an image starting at 0 0. There's no built in left, right, center, etc. like Ren'Py and the like, so you do have to do the math yourself sadly.

						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/06_music.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how music works.">
						<p>
							Just as a preface, music is where you'll have to break out Audacity. Audio just won't play over a certain sample rate (presumably due to the limitations of the DS, but I'm not 100% sure). So, to remedy this, I've used audacity to export any music file vnds will be using at a sample rate of 48,000Hz and a quality of 64kbps, which are default options when exporting a track with Audacity. vnds also only accepts .mp3 files. In terms of using the actual keyword, it's simple stuff. To play music, it's just the word "music" followed by the music file, and to stop music, it's just "music" followed by a "~".

						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/07_sound.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how sound works.">
						<p>
							Sound is a lot like music, just with a little more to it. First of all, like I mentioned, sound comes out a bit crusty as is with no working converter that I could find to do sounds properly. Still, to get a sound converted the "crusty" way, you need FFmpeg, and to run this command in command prompt: "ffmpeg -i "infile" -c:a aac -b:a 16k "outfile"". In terms of how it works within vnds, you play a sound by using the keyword "sound" followed by the file. And stop all sounds, it's "sound" followed by a "~" just like with music. The two extra lines are for number of times the sound will be repeated, with -1 being infinite. The last important thing to note is that sound is loaded into memory so sounds should be 1MB or less.

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/08_vars.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how vars work.">
						<p>
							Just like most programming languages, vnds has variables, but in line with vnds so far, they're very simple. There are two types, "setvar" which is for the current save, and "gsetvar" which is global, working across all saves. As an example of what to use them for, setvar could be used for points which count to a certain route. And gsetvar could be for an unlockable, like setting a variable for unlocking music the first time you listen to it. Variables can also only store integers and strings, and strings have to be stored in double quotes. A variable can also have basic operations applied to it, equals, addition, and subtraction. Double equals, greater than, greater than or equals, less than, and less than or equals also work for comparison. Finally, to call a variable, you prefix it with "$".

						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/09_ifs.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how ifs work.">
						<p>
							If statements work like other programming languages without elses... else ifs... And the left part of the comparison has to be a variable. But, as you can see, an if statement starts with "if" followed by a variable, then "==", ">", "&lt;", ">=" or "&lt;=", followed by a variable or hardcoded variable. The next lines after that are for whatever you want to happen in the if statement. They don't have to be indented, but I did so for readability. Finally, an if statement is ended with "fi".

					<div class="expandable-content">
						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/10_choices.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how choices work.">
						<p>
							Choices are for direct user choices, unlike if statements which are completely internal. As you can see, sto start a choice you use the keyword "choice" followed by the choice options, which are separated with a "|". Whether intentional or not (likely unintentional since it's buggy) there is a limit on how many choices one statement can have. I've found 8 to be the limit, and after that it gets weird and buggy, but it also might be based on number of characters, so take that with a grain of salt to some degree. What comes after the choice is probably the most important part, though, that being an if statement, it has to be in that exact format. Think of "selected" as a keyword in that sense. Then, the numbers represent the choices in order. It's a bit of a weird way to do it, but it does make sense and is fairly simple.

						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/11_labels_&_jumps.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how labels, jumps and goto work.">
						<p>
							Labels are basically ways to jump to specific points in the code. So, if you have "label gohere" you can use the line "goto gohere" to end up at that label. An Important note is that "goto" is only for labels in the current file. If you want to change files, you use "jump" followed by the filename. Then, if you want to go to a specific label in another file, you would use a line like "jump otherfile.scr coollabel". I'd say labels aren't completely required, but are extremely useful for making your vnds VNs use less files.

						<img class="center round" src="images/vnds/syntax/12_delay.png" alt="A screenshot of VS Code with examples of how delay works.">
						<p>
							Delay is probably the simplest piece of syntax in vnds. All it is is the keyword "delay" followed by a space and the time you want to pause for. It pauses everything except for currently playing sounds and music. Also, remember, the DS runs at 60 frames per second so "delay 60" would be 1 second.

							Random is another simple one. After you use the keyword "random" you follow it with the variable name you want to use and the two random integer values you want to use as a range. Both numbers are inclusive, meaning that in this example, "dice" will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. It's nothing crazy, but still something that could come in handy.

The ending tag is always the same, and the colour tags are the same aside from the two digit number, which corresponds to the colour itself. As far as I know, there's no meaning behind the number (i.e hex code or something like that), and the list of colours is short, so they will be listed here.

							So, that's how you make a vnds format visual novel. If you made it this far, then you're probably crazy in the fun way. Seriously though, you probably shouldn't make a vnds format novel if it's not something you truly, really care about. They're really primitive, and if you have an actual visual novel idea you want to act on, you should probably just use Ren'Py or something like that. Though, if you do end up deciding to make a vnds visual novel, please share it. vnds is super obscure, so any small thing you can do in relation to it is going to make a bigger over all impact than you may think. Either way, I think vnds is pretty cool, and I wanted to let people in on the coolness, hence the guide.

						<img class="center" src="images/vnds/vnds_renpy.png" alt="A screenshot of the vnds port of Tsukihime ported to Ren'Py.">
						<p>
							This one... Is a little bit insane. All the way back in 2009, the creator of Ren'Py himself made a was small program which converts vnds format visual novels... To Ren'Py. Considering that almost all the vnds ported novels are originally on PC, this is absolutely insane. I found it on an old forum post (which will be linked at the bottom of this article, along with other things I mention) and thought it was super cool! I'm glad that both me and Mr. PyTom both are fans of the obscure and useless!
						</p>
						<p>
							If (for whatever reason) you want to use this, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, since this was made in 2009, the Python file that converts the novels just straight up doesn't work with Python 3 sadly. I did a test conversion with the DS version (I don't believe the Android version existed yet, so you may not be able to convert those) of Tsukihime, and I used Python 2.7 which seemed to work fine. The second thing is that, after you convert, you have to change all instances of labels and jumps which use "main" to "start". I think it's just an issue with the differences between Ren'Py then and Ren'Py now, but I'm not sure. Finally, not all novels convert perfectly, even ignoring the main/start issue, so please be aware of that.

						<p>
							I suppose you could call DarkVN a fan made branch of vnds. It runs vnds format visual novels (allegedly, we'll get there) but it also has custom code and whatnot. It's also a PC program exclusively, but if you want more of a fix of vnds on PC, we'll get there. Weirdly, the example novel that comes with DarkVN does not work, as it's missing a "scriptinfo" file. After a little bit of digging, I've found out what this file is supposed to be and it's surprisingly simple! It's a file with no extension named "scriptinfo" with one line that points to what script file will be run first. As an example, every vnds novel starts with the "main.scr" script file, so if you wanted to run a vnds novel in DarkVN you have to create the "scriptinfo" file with "main.scr" as the first line in it.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, is that bit of trouble worth it to play what will most likely only be vnds novels through DarkVN? Not really, it's kind of crappy. It's not horrid or anything, it still runs the novels, but so does vnds through an emulator, or another piece of software we'll get to. When it comes to the making aspect, it's not really great there either since it's so similar to vnds. So a vnds novel can be played on all of these pieces of software in this section, but a DarkVN novel is specific to DarkVN, and the differences aren't really worth it. Still, this is a cool piece of history, and it doesn't hurt to check it out.

							Yeah, not too much to talk about with this one. It's made by the same person, and is pretty much just a better version of DarkVN. As a player, the screen resolution is a bit larger and more "visual novely" and less "DSy" so it's better from that point of view. And when it comes to the making point of view, there are added features and that sort of thing. Still, not the optimal way to play vnds novels on PC if you ask me, but still pretty neat.

							This is final in what I'll call the "darkwalker247" series, and this one technically doesn't count. It has a scripting language <i>inspired</i> by vnds, but it can't actually play vnds format visual novels. Still, when else am I going to get to mention Arc/Lite? I'd say Arc/Lite does look the most visually appealing of the three novel engines made by darkwalker247, and it seeems more like a passion project than the other two just on virtue of not having to accommodate vnds novels. Still, there's not much use for it nowadays since there are no novels (as far as I know) for it other than the tutorial. That just leaves creating, which if you want a novel on with a weird engine, use vnds, and if you want a proper novel, use Ren'Py. It's so niche it doesn't really have a niche. Still though, I think it's neat and worth saving.

							This is the most modern thing in relation to vnds, being last updated in 2023, and is probably the most useful. It's basically vnds but for a bunch of different systems, those being Windows, Mac, Linux, 3DS, and Switch. The screenshot up there is the Windows version, and it's kind of similar to the darkwalker247 PC vnds interpreters, but with a better UI. The interesting part of it is definitely that it can run on 3DS, and especially Switch. I just don't have a way to take screencaps on my 3DS, and I'm not inclined to hacking my Switch. Either way, it's another neat one, but because of it's practicality, it might actually be the most boring one in my eyes. Still, give it a try if you so wish.

							Although this is another fairly boring one, I do want to take the time to say that boring doesn't mean bad or that there was no effort put behind these "boring" ones, because there's tons of effort. It's just, not interesting to talk about really. This is the second of the 3DS interpreters as well, and although I can't say if it's better or worse than VNDS-LOVE, VNDS-LOVE is more recent. Either way, this is just piece of the vnds lore that I wanted to bring up and share. And even though I did use the word "boring," I'd still recommend giving this the time of day if it interests you.

							This is a little bit of a strange one. It's name really only represents one third of what Higurashi Vita is. Naturally, part of it is a PS Vita port of the vnds port of Higurashi When They Cry, but there are two other parts of it. The second is also fairly straightforward, that being a 3DS port of the vnds port of Higurashi, which is obviously less useful due to the other 3DS vnds interpreters. But the interesting part of this is that there's an entire port of vnds to the PS Vita. It's just weird to me, because why would you market this as Higurashi as the main thing. I do believe there are enhancements for the specific Higurashi ports, but still, I just find it a bit strange. It's still a cool one, and also the last of the console ports for this section.

							Now we're talking! vnds in your web browser proper! Now, this one can't be downloaded, and I couldn't get it to work after getting the files with web crawler, so it's completely web only as far as I understand. This also means that the six novels featured on the site are the only currently playable ones. Still, that doesn't make this any less cool if you ask me! If the (relatively) recent Tsukihime Web is anything to go by, there is a market for visual novels through a web page. Also, just as a note, I have checked and this does work through the Wayback Machine, so it still is archived. It's super neat, and if it weren't for the next one, this would probably be my favourite.

							This might be my favourite vnds interpreter. The original wins at the end of the day, and the darkwalker247 novel interpreters are pretty cool, but VNDS-online is basically a PC version and a web version. It is in Russian, but that only matters if you're playing in the web browser and for the menus. If you download it, it may as well be in English since the menus aren't hard to figure out. In the read me, there is a way to make it a web app, but with the slight language barrier and the fact that it still runs on PC made me decide to not bother. Despite it's simplicity, it's very visually appealing, and the only real weird thing to it is that novels <i>have</i> to have an "img.ini" file, which just has information on the icon size. You can look through the Android novels to see how the file works if need be. But yeah, this is a neat one.

						<p>
							I'm a pretty big fan of Milk Inside A Bag Of Milk Inside A Bag Of Milk (which, if I have to mention it by name again, I'll just call it "Milk"). It's a short, but pretty interesting visual novel, and one that found it's way into the mainstream not a while ago, even garnering a sequel. As a result, I decided to port it to vnds! I'm almost sure there are some issues, as I was ready to complete it for my Christmas break, but then some family issues distrupted my life. But since it was so close to completion, I did a bit of a rush job. I'll go back and fix any mistakes at some point, but for now it is as it comes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Another thing I want to make extremely clear is that I do not condone playing this version (or any vnds novel based on a paid for game, for that matter) unless you've paid for and have the original. I don't know how to make a vnds converter, and doing that makes the source code of a novel a little harder to get, so I can't stop you, but don't ruin it for everybody. This is a worse version of the game anyway, so just see it as this being a little fan made bonus that you get if you purchase the original.

							Before I even considered doing a port of Milk Inside A Bag Of Milk Inside A Bag Of Milk, I started work on this extension! This would have been all the way back in mid to late 2023, but I can't say for certain since it was before I started using GitHub. I actually almost completed it, only not having syntax highlighting for coloured text ironically enough. So, for a time, it was lost deep in many sub folders of my Windows 10 PC. Then, when I started making this page, I remembered it! To my surprise, it was in a state where I could finish it rather than start over, so I did! Then I went through the (only slightly painful) process of uploading it to the VSCode extension store! It's not super ultra impressive or anything, but I'm proud of this one since I'm certain it'll help someone... Probably... Maybe...  There's a small chance...

Going into this, I didn't realize there was so much vnds... Stuff! I had a lot of this stuff lined up before I went to make this website, but the web versions and stuff made by darkwalker247 was a complete surpise! It also got me to finish my VSCode extension, and gave me a few more ideas on how to contribute more to vnds myself. Anyway, if you've read through all of this, you're a true champ, I really appreciate it!
